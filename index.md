## The body mass index I

1. The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure of relative size based on the mass and height of an individual.
2. The BMI for a person is defined as their body mass divided by the square of their heightâ€”with the value universally being given in units of kg/m^2. 
3. So if the weight is in kilograms and the height in metres, the result is immediate, if pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor of 703 (kg/m2)/(lb/in2) must be applied.
4. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index for more details.

## BMIapp 

1. I build a simple shiny app usable to calculate the BMI for given height (cm) and weight (kg).
2. Visit https://mw89.shinyapps.io/BMIapp/ and try it out yourself!
3. Height and weight input is done by 2 sliders.
4. The server.R file contains the BMI formula

```r
round(input$weight/((input$height/100)^2), 2)
```
5. You can find the ui.R and server.R files here: https://github.com/MW89/dataproducts
6. unit convertion: 1 in = 2.54 cm / 1 lb = 0.45 kg

## BMIapp - sample calculation

```r
# input values:
input <- list(weight=80, height=180)

# calculate BMI:
round(input$weight/((input$height/100)^2), 2)   
```

```
